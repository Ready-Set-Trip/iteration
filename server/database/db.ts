// pull in db here 

// Not fully thought out ... but a start! To discuss as we put the pieces together! 
// will need table for user data (name, email, pw, login...) 
// will also need trip table ... something with unique trip id, trip name, trip start and end dates... naything else? 
// wondering how to handle which users are in which trips. perhaps another table that tracks this? (usernames or ids alongside trip ids?)
// will also need a table to track individual trackers for each user in trip .. i.e. (user_id, workoutdays, healthydays, duodays...)
